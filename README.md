This is a skeleton repo that can be used as an easy way to get started with the [University of Washington Programming Languages Course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/programming-languages/home/welcome).

> This repo does not contain any solutions or examples of working through the material in the course. It is just a skeleton to make it easier for others to get started with the course.

To use this skeleton you can clone it locally and then use [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and [Remote Containers](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers) extension.
This will allow you to work through the course without needed to install or uninstall any code on your machine.
Just open the project in VSCode, and then use remote containers to open the "A", "B" or "C" directory in their own dev images. Then you can go to any file and use the default build task (Cmd+Shift+B) to run that file.
